## Contents

This repository contains the source code, flowcharts, presentation, report and analysis done as a part of this project.

## Description

This project implements the real time and non-real time concepts that were covered in class. Threads are created in order to capture, process and dump images. These processes must be monitored with the help of a sequencer which decides rate at which these services are called upon. </br>
Rate Monotonic Analysis has been utilised to schedule various services. Socket communication has been established between two RPi 3 B boards.
